# 1 - Get set up

If you don't have it already, follow the instructions to [install the Prototype Kit](/docs/install).

You should have the Prototype Kit up and running on your computer before continuing.

Steps to complete:

1. Install the Prototype Kit and check it works - visit http://localhost:3000
2. Open the Prototype Kit folder in Atom text editor

Overview of Prototype Kit folders:

- **/app** is for your work
  - **views** is for html
  - **assets** is for CSS, JavaScript and images
  - **routes.js** is for advanced logic - for example if a user should go to one page or another. We'll cover it later
- **/docs** has examples and templates

Ignore everything else.
